// Developer Notes

	Post Deadline Notes - 31/03/2016

		- Early models such as 'ProductsModel.php' need to be written to increase security against SQL injection 
			- For examples of more see 'Delete' methods in the 'AdmineProjects.php', 'AdminProducts.php' and 'AdmineApplications.php' Classes
		- Early Models should also be written to use proper Get and Set Methods see 'ApplicationModel.php' and 'EditApplicationModel.php' classes for examples.
		- Front End has not been developed beyond what was required to develop backend testing


	Future Improvments
		- Some models need to be updated to protect against SLQ injection
		- App.php Code should be refactored and simplified 
		- Model Classes could be considlated for simplicity
		- DB Class needs to be refractored, some functions are duplicated
		- sainitzing function needs to be added to all out put in views.
		- Change Property Visibility in Models to private and protected respectively, all currently public, this is unsecure and bad practice
